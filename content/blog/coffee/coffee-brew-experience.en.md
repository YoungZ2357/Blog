### 1. Kanzu, Rwanda

Flavor Notes: Orange, Black Tea, Plum

Varietal: French Mission Bourbon

Process: Washed

#### Brewing (**Pour-Over**):

- 92°C (198°F)
- Water ratio: 2 (bloom) - 8 - 7

> Note: Requires familiarity with the coffee to detect the black tea notes

### 2. Datera, Sundrop, Brazil

Flavor Notes: Buttery Caramel, Blueberry, Clover (what even is this...)

Varietal: Yellow Bourbon & Pink Bourbon Blend

Process: Natural (Sun-dried)

#### Brewing (**Pour-Over**)

- 88°C (190°F)
- Water ratio: 2 (bloom) - 8 - 7

#### **Cold Brew** - Wine-like Character

Remarkably, despite no fermentation processing, this bean develops a distinct wine-like flavor by combining its acidity with blueberry notes

- Coffee to water ratio: 1:18
- Same grind size as pour-over (otherwise the wine character disappears)
- Successful example: 12 hours

### 3. El Menson, Fall Harvest, Colombia

Flavor Notes: Rose, White Honey (huh?), Cherry

Varietal: Pink Bourbon

Process: Washed

#### Brewing (Pour-Over)

- 92°C (198°F)
- Water ratio: 2 (bloom) - 10 - 7

If egg white and yolk can mimic crab, then this Bourbon can rival Gesha—the **floral notes** and aftertaste are exceptionally pronounced. Must brew while fresh.

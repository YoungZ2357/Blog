### 1. Kanzu, Rwanda

Flavor Notes: Orange, Black Tea, Plum

Varietal: French Mission Bourbon

Process: Washed

#### Brewing (**Pour-Over**):

- 92°C (198°F)
- Water ratio: 2 (bloom) - 8 - 7

> Note: Requires familiarity with the coffee to detect the black tea notes

### 2. Datera, Sundrop, Brazil

Flavor Notes: Buttery Caramel, Blueberry, Clover (what even is this...)

Varietal: Yellow Bourbon & Pink Bourbon Blend

Process: Natural (Sun-dried)

#### Brewing (**Pour-Over**)

- 88°C (190°F)
- Water ratio: 2 (bloom) - 8 - 7

#### **Cold Brew** - Wine-like Character

Remarkably, despite no fermentation processing, this bean develops a distinct wine-like flavor by combining its acidity with blueberry notes

- Coffee to water ratio: 1:18
- Same grind size as pour-over (otherwise the wine character disappears)
- Successful example: 12 hours

> Caution: **Low success rate (2 successful samples / 5 total attempts)**

### 3. El Meson, Fall Harvest, Colombia

Flavor Notes: Rose, White Honey (huh?), Cherry

Varietal: Pink Bourbon

Process: Washed

#### Brewing (Pour-Over)

- 92°C (198°F)
- Water ratio: 2 (bloom) - 10 - 7

If egg white and yolk can mimic crab, then this Bourbon can rival Gesha—the **floral notes** and aftertaste are exceptionally pronounced. Must brew while fresh.

### 4. Mamuto, Kenya AB Medium

Flavor Notes: Plum, Blackberry, Dark Chocolate

Varietal: SL28

Process: Washed (likely Kenya's distinctive washed method, given it's from George Howell)

**Roast: Medium**

This Kenya has a unique, indescribable quality—not quite tea-like, not floral, and lacking any fermented notes. Perhaps it's a characteristic specific to SL28 beans with medium roast?

To be honest, I'm not particularly fond of this coffee. It doesn't deliver the intense acidity I crave from SL28. Perhaps my love for this varietal was forever frozen in that afternoon when I had my first specialty coffee—chatting with friends at that small café on Shuangnan Road. Back then, I didn't worry about adapting to American life, maintaining my GPA, burning through my study-abroad funds without results, or navigating interactions with Americans. I was dreaming about earning dollars, planning post-graduation achievements, expecting to make my first fortune soon to treat my mom—those days are gone. Maybe it's best to let this varietal remain in that distant past, where it's most beautiful.

#### Brewing (Pour-Over)

- 92°C (198°F) (Higher temperature is essential to bring out SL28's acidity)
- Water ratio: 2 (bloom) - 8 - 7

This SL28 perfectly embodies the characteristics of medium roast: one half is the straightforward, even crude charred notes from darker roasting, while the other half retains the bean's inherent flavors from lighter roasting.
